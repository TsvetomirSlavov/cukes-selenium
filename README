I've become very interested in Cucumber over the last month and I wanted to give it a test run with webrat/selenium to get a feel for it.

Here are a few basic web examples with Cucumber and Selenium. 
You have to manually start up a selenium remote controll process in order to run the examples.
I wasn't a fan of the default webrat/selenium RC settings so I wanted to specify my own.

Terminal 1:
java -jar selenium-server.jar -timeout 15 -singleWindow -port 4444

Terminal 2:
cucumber features
